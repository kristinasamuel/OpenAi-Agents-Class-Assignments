## Assignment 3: Math Function Tool Agent

### Objective: 
- Build an agent that can use a math function as a tool (for example, addition or multiplication).


## Tasks:
- Define a Python function, e.g., def add(a, b): return a + b
- Register this function as a tool with your agent.
- Make the agent able to decide when to use the tool (e.g., “What is 5 + 7?” triggers the function).
- Test the agent with at least three math questions.
